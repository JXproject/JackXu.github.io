                        <p class="project-para">
                            In grade 12 computer engineering course, I learned and practice the graphic programming to prototype simple embedded system. Through series of challenges, I demonstrated superior capacity of understanding new concepts and effectively apply all learned knowledge to the projects, and effectively created new and alternative designs and ideas. Particularly, my final class project on the prototype of a microwave oven impressed teacher, who suggested me to lead a team of 2 and compete on Robotics and Control System Design in Halton Skills. Subsequently, for the sake of enriching my experience and due to my passion in robotics, I went for the competition. During the competition, I demonstrated my excellent time management, problem solving skills, and leadership.

                        <p class="project-para">
                            Because of being chosen for the competition, I am so ecstatic and did a lot of extra practice and experiments with different mechanisms, sensors, and topics. For example, in three floor elevator, I designed a simple mechanism but useful for most projects, acting as a master emergency stop for shutting down all operating machines by one clicking for additional safety feature to prevent the failure of software stop. Additionally, I designed physical stops and emergency light signals to ensure the prototype is safe for users under any possible situation. Beyond practicing mechanical construction, I also tried multiple programming structure such as time based, if-statement based, and variable based programming for different purposes and problems. Furthermore, I did varied researches on mechanical structure on daily embedded system and proper schematic drawings. On last weekends before competition, I collaborated with my friend (Peter) on sample problems. During the meeting, we arranged the time for competition and allotted workload. Accordingly, I mainly work on the programming, wiring, and schematic drawings due to better understanding on these fields than Peter, while, he focused on mechanical construction and project report. Since Peter’s lack of mechanical experience, I shared some of my innovative ideas on mechanical building and past researches on different mechanism. After one day of collaboration, we are pretty confident for any challenges.

                        <p class="project-para">
                            On the day of competition, we carried equipments and parts that are already sorted by us into the competing arena and were ready for 3-hour design battle. First project was the vehicle lifter. For this project, I discussed with Peter and shared my past experience and observation of the lifter in Grade 11 Transportation Technology class. Based on the description and my experience, I listed tasks that are mandatory and extra functions in order to create a flow chart and task hierarchy. After discussion and topic break down, I started programming using flow charts, while Peter started his construction. We spent an hour of building and half hour of debugging. However, the progress did not work as what I expected but a bit delay. For the second project, we quickly adjusted our time plan and minimize unnecessary steps and accelerate our pace.

                            Eventually, we won the first place and earned qualification for Ontario Skill Competition. In addition, my programming layout and comments got highly acknowledgement from the judges for its simplicity and optimization. Furthermore, my innovative idea of physical emergency stop also amazed the judge. From the process of the competition including previous preparation and later discussion with other competitors and judges, I learned many new knowledge beyond the course-contents, meanwhile, for the most important part, my communication, problem solving, and experience got rich and enhanced.
