### Why ROS?

- **Collaborative Dev.**
- **Language Support:**
  - C++
  - Python 
  - Lisp
  - Java 
  - Lua
- **Library Integration:**
  - [Open-CV](http://wiki.ros.org/vision_opencv)
  - [PCL (Point Cloud Library)](http://wiki.ros.org/pcl_ros)

### Fundamentals of ROS

#### File System Level:

```mermaid
graph TD
A[ROS File System Level] -->B(Metapackages)
    B --> D 
    B --> C{Packages}
    C --> D[Package Manifest]
    C --> E[Messages]
    C --> F[Services]
    C --> G[Codes]
    C --> H[Misc]
```

- File **System** Level
  - **Metapackages**: group together a list of packages for a specific application. It can hold info. on related packages to install
  - **Packages**: Software in ROS is mainly organized as ROS packages. 
    - ROS packages are the atomic build unit of ROS
    - This single module consists of:
      - ROS nodes/processes
      - datasets
      - configuration files 
  - **Package** **Manifest**: Every package will contain a manifest file called ==package.xml==
    - It consists of info. such as the name, version, author, license, and dependencies required for the package
    - The package.xml of a @Metapackage consists of the names of related packages
  - **Messages(msg)**: ROS communicates by sending ROS msgs. Type of msg data defined inside a file with ==.msg==. (File hierarchy convention: pkg_name/msg/msgName.msg) “More like a P2P DM”
  - **Service(srv)**: “Broadcasting” kinda of idea. Services: client and server. Same idea as network.

#### Computation Graph Level

```mermaid
graph TD
A{Master}
B[Node1] 
C[Node2] 
D[Parameter Server]
E(Topic)
F(Topic)
G(Service)
H(Service)
	B -->|Pub| E
	B -->|Advertise| G
	C -->|Pub| F
	C -->|Advertise| H
	A -->|Sub|E
	A -->|Client|G
	A -->|Sub|F
	A -->|Client|H
	D --> A
	A --> D
	A --> Bags
	
    
```

- Graph Level:
  - **Nodes**: 
    - A process uses ROS APIs to comm. with each other
  - **Master**: 
    - an intermediate node that aids connections btwn diff. ROS nodes.
    - It has all the details about all nodes running in ROS env.
    - Help to establish communication btween the two ROS nodes.
  - **Parameter Server**:
    - Pretty useful thing
    - A node can ==store a variable== in the parameter server and set its ==privacy==
    - if it is global scope, it can be accessed by all other nodes
    - Runs along with ROS master
  - **Messages**:
    - a data structure used by ROS nodes to ==exchange data==
    - nodes send and recv. data in the form of ROS msgs. 
  - **Topics**:   
    - Topics are ==named buses==, in which data is exchanged ==using ROS msgs==. 
    - Each topic has a specific name
    - One node can ==**publish**== data to a topic, and other nodes can read from the topic by ==**subscribing**==
  - **Services**:
    - a request and response method is used.
    - One node can act as the service provider by ==**advertising**==, and other nodes can be client to request services and wait until the server responds with the results.
  - **Bags**:
    - Useful utility in ROS for recording and playback of ROS topics
    - We can record sensor data and play back

### ROS Client Libs

- roscpp: high-performance applications & recommended
- Rosy: pure implementation of the ROS client library in Python.

### ROS Tools

- Rviz (ROS Visualizer): visualize both 2D & 3D values from ROS topics and parameters
- Rqt_plot: plotting scalar values that are in the form of ROS topics
- rqt_graph: ROS GUI tool can visualize the graph of interconnection btwn ROS nodes
